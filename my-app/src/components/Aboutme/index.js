            Hello, my name is Bianca Tijerino. I was born in Miami, Florida, lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, and ended
      up in San Tan Vally, Arizona!
      I have 2 children who have inspired me to broaden my horizons and dive deep into my goals and passions,
      including starting this new journey into coding.
      I enjoy watching my 2 littles ones blossom, music that makes me feel good, and getting in a good sweat
      session with Pilates. I am very excited for what the coding world has to offer
            </p>
