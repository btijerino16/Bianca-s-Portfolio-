            Hello, my name is Bianca Tijerino. I was born in Miami, Florida, lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, and ended up in San Tan Vally, Arizona! 
            I have 2 children who have inspired me to broaden my horizons and dive deep into my goals and passions, including starting this new journey into coding.
            I enjoy watching my 2 littles ones blossom, music that makes me feel good, and getting in a good sweat session with Pilates.
